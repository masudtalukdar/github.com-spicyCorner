This has led Bangladeshi cuisine to include many rich aromatic dishes such as biriyani and korma that requires the use of a large array of spices along with an extensive amount of ghee.<br> Dhaka being the Mughal capital of the Bengal Subah (which includes the modern Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal) was a major trading center in South Asia, so many culinary styles from around the world influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal, the Bangladeshi populace began to adopt the cuisine of the city with many unknown Persian, Turkish and Arabic-influenced dishes becoming popular </p></h1>
